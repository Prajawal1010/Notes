In a Dockerfile, both ADD and COPY instructions are used to copy files and directories from the host filesystem into the Docker image, but they have some key differences:

COPY
Purpose: Simple file and directory copying.
Functionality: Only supports copying files and directories from the local filesystem to the image

Syntax : COPY <source> <destination>

Use Case: Recommended for most cases where you just want to copy files without any additional processing.

ADD
Purpose: More versatile than COPY.
Functionality:
Can copy files and directories from the local filesystem.
Can also fetch files from a URL (HTTP/HTTPS).
Can automatically extract compressed files (like .tar, .gz, etc.) when copied.
Syntax: ADD <source> <destination>

Use Case: Use when you need the additional functionality of fetching files from URLs or unpacking archives. However, this can introduce complexity and unintended behavior if not used carefully.
Summary
Use COPY for straightforward copying tasks.
Use ADD only when you need its specific features (e.g., fetching from a URL or extracting archives).
For most cases, COPY is preferred for clarity and simplicity.
